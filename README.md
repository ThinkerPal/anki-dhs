# Anki Revision App  

This app is made for DHS computing students to revise their work 

This app is based on the client template found at buildingblocs/vuetify-todo-app. Major thanks to ThePyProgrammer for setting the template up

## Project Checklist:
[] Python executable for distribution
[] Scripted compilation of python executable (integrate into npm run dist)
[] Run app with pyinstaller's version of backend 
[] Move entire project over to js-based vue since we are not using typescript for this project
[] Figure out how to include python backend in electron distribution
[] Figure out codesigning and distribution (the actual npm run dist script)

## Project setup
Before you start developing, run `npm run setup` to set up your developing space

### How to run the application locally
```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production (to ~~unreadable~~ HTML/CSS/JS)
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

^ For this, you should simply try to use Visual Studio Code with the Lint plugins (Likely with Vetur).
