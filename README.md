# Anki Revision App  

This app is made for DHS computing students to revise their work 

This app is based on the client template found at buildingblocs/vuetify-todo-app. Major thanks to ThePyProgrammer for setting the template up



## Project setup
Before you start developing, run `npm run setup` to set up your developing space

### How to run the application locally
```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production (to ~~unreadable~~ HTML/CSS/JS)
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

^ For this, you should simply try to use Visual Studio Code with the Lint plugins (Likely with Vetur).
